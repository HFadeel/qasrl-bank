Scala code for using QA-SRL can be found in the
[qasrl-crowdsourcing](https://github.com/julianmichael/qasrl-crowdsourcing)
repository. This contains data structures for processing questions, extracting their syntax,
doing autocomplete, crowdsourcing QA-SRL, and processing the QA-SRL dataset.

Types and JSON encoders/decoders for the data are in the `qasrl.data` package.
Usage notes coming soon (once I get that library published on Maven). For now, refer to the readme
in that repository.
